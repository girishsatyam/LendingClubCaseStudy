## General Information

### Project Information

> This project involves utilizing the provided Lending Club dataset for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into risk analytics within the banking and financial services sector. Additionally, it aims to explore how data can be employed to mitigate financial losses when lending to customers.


### Project Background

#### Goal
> How data can be harnessed to reduce the likelihood of financial losses when extending loans to customers.

#### Risk Associated 

> When an applicant is predicted to be capable of loan repayment, declining their loan application results in a missed opportunity for the company (rejecting loans for non-default cases).
> When the applicant is unlikely to meet the loan repayment requirements, granting the loan could potentially result in financial losses for the company (approving loans for default cases).

> The provided dataset includes data on previous loan applicants and their default status. Each row in the dataset represents the loan specifics for individual applicants.

### Project Statement

> The company aims to identify the key factors influencing loan defaults, which are often referred to as 'driver variables.' By conducting this case study, the company can leverage this knowledge to enhance its portfolio and risk assessment processes.

### Data Set

> The dataset is in CSV format & it contains Loan-related information for Lending Club.
